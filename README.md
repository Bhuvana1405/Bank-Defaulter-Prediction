The dataset contains information about credit applicants. Banks, globally, use
this kind of dataset and type of informative data to create models to help in
deciding on who to accept/refuse for a loan.
After all the exploratory data analysis, cleansing and dealing with all the
anomalies we might (will) find along the way, the patterns of a good/bad
applicant will be exposed to be learned by machine learning models.
We are dealing with a supervised binary classification problem. The goal is to
train the best machine learning model to maximize the predictive capability of
deeply understanding the past customerâ€™s profile and minimizing the risk of
future loan defaults.
